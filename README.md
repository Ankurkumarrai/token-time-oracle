#  Historical Token Price Oracle with Interpolation Engine

A full-stack application that enables users to query the historical price of ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and Polygon networks. If the exact price is not available, it calculates an interpolated value using surrounding data points. It also provides a scheduling feature to fetch the complete daily price history of a token from its creation date to the present.

##  Features

### Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind + Zustand)
- **Token Price Form**: Enter `tokenAddress`, select `network`, and input `timestamp`
- **Result Display**: Shows price with source (cache, alchemy, interpolated)
- **Schedule Button**: Triggers full historical price fetch
- **Progress Bar**: Visual feedback for schedule completion

### Backend (Node.js + Express + Redis + BullMQ)
- **GET /price**: Query price for a token at a specific time
- **POST /schedule**: Start background job to fetch token's full history
- **Redis Caching**: 5-minute TTL to reduce latency
- **BullMQ Scheduler**: Fetches and stores prices daily in MongoDB
- **Interpolation Engine**: Estimates price between two known values
- **Alchemy SDK**: Used for historical price and first transaction date
